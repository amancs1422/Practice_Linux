## How to fetch content from an API and make something fun?

### Step 1: Locate a perfect looking API from a sea of ugly, hairy and bald ones, just kidding.

### Step 2: Use below command to leverage the API:
```
curl -H "Accept : text/plain" https://icanhazdadjoke.com/ 
```

The curl command is a command-line tool and library for transferring data with URL syntax. It is widely used for sending and receiving data over various network protocols, including HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SFTP, and more.

curl is powered by libcurl for all transfer-related features.
